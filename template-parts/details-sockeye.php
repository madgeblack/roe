					Roe exists as a platform because Sockeye 
					has shared their resources, confidence, 
					and power with us.<br><br>

					The trust of their partnership allows us to focus our efforts and energies on work that is good for our partners, and is also just plain good.<br><br>

					Sockeye has helped make room for our 
					voices to shape real change.<br><br>

					Roe is Roe because Sockeye believes in it.
